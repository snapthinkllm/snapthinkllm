# SnapThink Notebook System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

We have successfully refactored your SnapThink Electron + React + Vite app from a chat-based system to a comprehensive notebook-based architecture. Here's what has been implemented:

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### 1. **New Folder Structure**
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── NotebookDashboard.jsx      # Main dashboard with notebook cards
│   ├── NotebookWorkspace.jsx      # Individual notebook interface
│   ├── NotebookSidebar.jsx        # Sidebar with files/plugins/settings
│   ├── MigrationDialog.jsx        # Migration wizard
│   └── MediaDisplay.jsx           # (existing)
├── hooks/
│   ├── useNotebookManager.js      # Notebook operations hook
│   ├── useChatManager.js          # (existing, for compatibility)
│   └── useDocumentManager.js      # (existing)
└── App.jsx                        # Refactored to route between views
```

### 2. **Notebook Data Structure**
Each notebook is stored as:
```
notebooks/
├── notebook-{timestamp}-{uuid}/
│   ├── notebook.json          # Metadata, settings, plugins
│   ├── messages.json          # Chat history
│   ├── docs/                  # Document uploads
│   ├── images/                # Image files
│   ├── videos/                # Video files
│   └── outputs/               # Generated outputs
```
